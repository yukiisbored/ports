# Yuki's personal openbsd-wip tree

These are my personal WIP ports, I will (not) push them to upstream
ports tree[^1].


[^1]: This is just a reference from an anime series called Evangelion
      (You should watch it.). I'll try to maintain and push them to
      upstream ports when I'm sure that I'll be capable of doing it.
