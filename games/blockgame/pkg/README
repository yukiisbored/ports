Minecraft and Java compatibility
================================

Starting with Minecraft 1.13, Minecraft recommends using newer
versions of the Java runtime instead of Java 1.8.

However, it is important to note that older versions of Minecraft
(especially with mods) will not play well with the latest version of
Java.

By default, games/blockgame is configured to play the latest version
of Minecraft (use games/lwjgl3 and devel/jdk%17 as runtime dependencies).

Running older versions of Minecraft
-----------------------------------

- For Minecraft <= 1.12.2, use Java 1.8 and make sure LWJGL 2 is
  installed.

  # pkg_add jdk%1.8 lwjgl

- While Minecraft 1.13 - 1.16.5 can run on newer versions, mod loaders
  are known to be broken on versions newer than 11:

  # pkg_add jdk%11

- Since Minecraft 1.17, it is required to use the latest version of
  Java.

Change Java installation for a Minecraft instance
-------------------------------------------------

1. Right click the instance and select "Edit Instance".
2. Go to "Settings" and click on "Auto-detect..." under "Java
   installation".
3. Select which version of Java you want to use.

Migrating from MultiMC to Blockgame
===================================

Due to the name change, Blockgame data directory is changed to
~/.local/share/Blockgame.

To migrate your existing MultiMC instances to Blockgame, simply move
~/.local/share/multimc to ~/.local/share/Blockgame.

$ mv ~/.local/share/multimc ~/.local/share/Blockgame
