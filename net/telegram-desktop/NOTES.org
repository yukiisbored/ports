* Attempts

** Attempt #1 - Gut out calls (No [[https://github.com/desktop-app/tg_owt][tg_owt]], No libtgvoip, No libtgcall)

   Too much stuff relies on WebRTC, for some /fucking/ reason.

   At this point, might as well write a sniod backend for libtgvoip
   along with adding tg_owt to the source code as /for some fucking
   reason/ it isn't part of the /fucking/ repo submodules.

   Oh well.

   [[https://github.com/Kurento/libusrsctp][libusrsctp]] might be required, however I'm not certain. Skimming it,
   it seems like it has conditions OpenBSD? Maybe some support? Not
   sure.
