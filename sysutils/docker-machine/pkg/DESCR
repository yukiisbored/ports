Docker Machine is a tool that lets you install Docker Engine on
virtual hosts, and manage the hosts with docker-machine commands. You
can use Machine to create Docker hosts on your local Mac or Windows
box, on your company network, in your data center, or on cloud
providers like Azure, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
